============

This repository includes data, scripts and benchmarks from UC Berkeley PhD dissertation: [Bounds on the Energy Consumption of Computational Kernels](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2014/EECS-2014-175.pdf), published in 2014. It's a static repo for completeness, and hasn't been touched for a while.
