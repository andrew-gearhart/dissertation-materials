This repo contains code and data discussed within my PhD dissertation in computer science titled "Bounds on the
Energy Consumption of Computational Kernels". The repo is sorted according to dissertation chapter, to aid interested
parties. As a disclaimer, the code within this repo was not written in an especially scalable manner and
has not been tested outside the confines of the specific testbed environments discussed in the dissertation. Thus,
some code hacking (and modification of system settings) may be required for benchmarking code to compile and run
correctly.
